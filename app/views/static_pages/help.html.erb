<a id="createstudy"></a><h3>Create a Study</h3>
<p>To create a study, you need to have an account and be logged in.  If you're not, <%= link_to "go set one up or log in", new_user_session_path %> and then come back.  We'll wait.</p>
<p>Ok, to create our study we need to first create the question we want to ask, and then select a group of images to compare with each other.
<ol>
<li>Click on Public Studies or My Research</li>
<li>At the bottom of the list of studies, click the Create a New Study button.</li>
<li>Fill in a name and a description for your study.</li>
<li>Fill in the Question for Voter.  This is the question you would like study participants to answer, choosing between two photos.</li>
<li>Select whether or not you would like to Share your Research.  This cannot be changed once the study is created.</li>
<li>Click on Create Study.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your study has been created, but isn't much use without images.  So, next, we need to add some areas.</p>
<a id="areas"></a><h3>Adding and Editing Areas</h3>
<p>Areas are essential to studies.  An Area defines the geographic boundaries within which the application will pull images for a study.</p>
<p>Users will be directed to add an area immediately after creating a study, but can also access this function through the Curate tab once a study has been created.</p>
<ol>
<li>The controls on the Google Map on the right side of the window will allow you to zoom in and out and move around the map (click and drag to move).
* However, don't single click in the map until you've navigated to the desired area. *  </li>
<li>The controls on the Google Map on the right side of the window will allow you to zoom in and out and move around the map (click and drag to move).
<strong>However, do not single click in the map until you've navigated to the desired area.</strong></li>
<li>Once you have located the desired area, we want to draw a polygon.  The study will pull images from inside that space.  Click once in the map to place the first point.</li>
<li>Click at least two more times to make points for the corners of your polygon.  Keep clicking until the space has been defined.</li>
<li>Fill in a name and a description for the area.</li>
<li>Fill in how many images you would like and how far apart they should be.</li>
<li>At this point, you can click on Save and Return to Study, which will bring you to your study's home page. Or, you can opt to add another area, if you want the study to pull images from multiple areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before launching your study, you can add, delete, and modify images within each area under your study's curate tab.</p>
